## Basic App on Tkinter
On this little project I build my first application with Python using Tkinter for a basic interface. This project was for my class of Communications 1 in my University. This database was built with just a little bit of programming experience on Python, most of the time I use MatLab for Electrical Engineering classes.

### Requirements
To built this basic app you need Python 3.xx enviroment and some ide. Also you need to import the tkinter library and use the pillow library as well. Just with:

`pip install Pillow`

The pictures to display in the app are in this link : http://bit.ly/3rMQnX4

This basic program took me a day with all the objects built and knowing how to use the different libraries. You can use and refer to this code to built your own desktop app.
